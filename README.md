Hello everyone! This is some *working* Python code to compare cell phone plans across different U.S. providers. 

# Web Interface
Started in index.html. My goal is to get it working with Brython so I don't have to learn Javascript, but I am open to changing. I couldn't get the form submission to submit the javascript/python function. 

I'm open to pull requests!
